> **flutter_spinning_wheel**

**Overview:**

The flutter_spinning_wheel package provides a customizable widget for
creating spinning wheels in Flutter applications. It allows for basic
customization of the wheel's appearance and behavior.

**Key** **Features** **and** **Customization** **Options:**

> **Image-based** **Wheel:** The wheel itself is rendered from an image,
> allowing for custom designs. Users can replace the image with their
> preference.
>
> **Dividers:** The number of divisions in the wheel can be speciﬁed,
> assuming all divisions are equal.
>
> **Dimensions:** width and height parameters control the size of the
> wheel container.
>
> **Initial** **Spin** **Angle:** initialSpinAngle allows setting an
> initial rotation for the wheel.
>
> **Spin** **Resistance:** spinResistance ( . to . ) inﬂuences the speed
> and deceleration of the wheel.
>
> **Interaction** **during** **Spin:** canInteractWhileSpinning
> (boolean) determines if the user can stop the wheel while it's
> spinning.
>
> **Secondary** **Image:** A secondaryImage can be rendered on top of
> the wheel, unaﬀected by the animation, with customizable
> secondaryImageHeight,
>
> secondaryImageWidth, secondaryImageTop, and secondaryImageLeft for
> ﬁne-tuning its position.
>
> **Callbacks:**
>
> onUpdate(int value): Executed when the selected divider changes during
> the animation.
>
> onEnd(int value): Executed when the animation stops.
>
> **Integration** **with** **Scoring** **(Example):** The example
> demonstrates a basic scoring system using a StreamBuilder and a
> RouletteScore widget, mapping divider values to reward labels (e.g., '
> ′,′ 400'). This is a basic example and would need to be expanded for a
> full SDK.

**Limitations/Considerations** **for** **SDK** **Development:**

> **Image-dependent** **Customization:** While ﬂexible, relying solely
> on images for wheel design might limit dynamic customization of
> individual segment colors, text, or icons without regenerating the
> image. A more programmatic approach for segment rendering would oﬀer
> greater ﬂexibility.
>
> **Basic** **Scoring:** The provided example for scoring is very
> rudimentary. A full SDK would require a more robust and extensible
> scoring system.
>
> **No** **Built-in** **Leaderboards,** **Notiﬁcations,** **Analytics:**
> The package focuses purely on the UI widget and does not include any
> features related to leaderboards, notiﬁcations, or analytics. These
> would need to be developed as separate components within the SDK.
>
> **Security** **and** **Reliability:** As a UI package, it doesn't
> address security or reliability concerns for an SDK. These aspects
> would need to be handled at the SDK level.
>
> **Documentation:** While the Readme provides basic usage, a
> comprehensive SDK would require extensive documentation for
> developers.
>
> **Dart** **Incompatible:** The package is years old and marked as Dart
>
> incompatible, which is a signiﬁcant concern for a modern Flutter SDK.

**Conclusion:**

The flutter_spinning_wheel package provides a good starting point for
the core spin wheel UI. However, a complete SDK would require signiﬁcant
additional development for advanced customization, scoring,
leaderboards, notiﬁcations,

analytics, security, reliability, and comprehensive documentation. The
age and Dart

incompatibility of this package suggest that building a new, modern spin
wheel widget from scratch or ﬁnding a more actively maintained
alternative might be necessary for a robust SDK.

> **flutter_fortune_wheel**

**Overview:**

The flutter_fortune_wheel package oﬀers highly customizable fortune
wheel widgets for Flutter, supporting mobile, desktop, and web
platforms. It provides more advanced customization options compared to
flutter_spinning_wheel.

**Key** **Features** **and** **Customization** **Options:**

> **Programmatic** **Item** **Deﬁnition:** Instead of relying on a
> single image, FortuneItem objects deﬁne individual segments of the
> wheel. Each FortuneItem can have a child widget (e.g., Text, Icon) and
> a style
>
> property for ﬁne-grained control over its appearance.
>
> **Individual** **Item** **Styling:** FortuneItemStyle allows
> customization of color (ﬁll color), borderColor, and borderWidth for
> each segment, enabling dynamic visual changes without image
> manipulation.
>
> **Style** **Strategies:** StyleStrategy allows applying common styling
> logic to all items. AlternatingStyleStrategy and UniformStyleStrategy
> are provided, and custom strategies can be implemented.
>
> **Physics-based** **Interaction:** The physics property, which expects
> an implementation of PanPhysics, controls touch and drag input.
>
> CircularPanPhysics (for FortuneWheel) and
> DirectionalPanPhysics.horizontal (for FortuneBar) are available, and
>
> custom PanPhysics subclasses can be created.
>
> **onFling** **Callback:** This callback is triggered when a ﬂing
> gesture is detected, allowing for selection of a new random item.
>
> **Customizable** **Indicators:** FortuneIndicator allows customization
> of the position indicators. TriangleIndicator and RectangleIndicator
> are provided, and custom indicator widgets can be used.
>
> **Fortune** **Bar:** In addition to the circular wheel, a FortuneBar
> widget is provided for scenarios where vertical screen space is
> limited.
>
> **Dart** **Compatible:** This package is actively maintained and
> compatible with Dart .

**Strengths** **for** **SDK** **Development:**

> **High** **Customizability:** The programmatic approach to deﬁning and
> styling wheel segments makes it highly suitable for an SDK that
> requires extensive customization of colors, text, and icons.
>
> **Flexible** **Interaction:** The physics-based interaction and
> onFling callback provide good control over the spinning behavior.
>
> **Active** **Development:** Being Dart compatible and actively
> maintained is a signiﬁcant advantage for building a modern SDK.
>
> **Cross-Platform** **Support:** Works across mobile, desktop, and web,
> which is beneﬁcial for a versatile SDK.

**Limitations/Considerations** **for** **SDK** **Development:**

> **No** **Built-in** **Scoring,** **Leaderboards,** **Notiﬁcations,**
> **Analytics:** Similar to flutter_spinning_wheel, this package focuses
> on the UI component and does
>
> not include features like scoring systems, leaderboards, notiﬁcations,
> or analytics. These would need to be integrated separately.
>
> **Security** **and** **Reliability:** The package itself doesn't
> inherently address SDK-level security or reliability concerns.
>
> **Documentation:** While good for a package, an SDK would require more
> comprehensive documentation, including integration guides, API
> references, and best practices.

**Conclusion:**

The flutter_fortune_wheel package is a much stronger candidate for the
core spin wheel UI component of the SDK due to its high customizability,
programmatic approach to segment deﬁnition, and active development. It
provides a solid foundation upon which to build the required features
for the SDK, such as advanced customization, scoring, leaderboards,
notiﬁcations, analytics, security, and comprehensive documentation.

**Phase** **:** **Develop** **Security** **and** **Analytics**
**Framework**

This phase focuses on outlining the robust security measures and
comprehensive analytics framework essential for a reliable and
insightful SDK. These aspects are critical for protecting user data,
preventing abuse, and providing valuable insights into SDK usage and
user engagement.

**.** **Security** **Framework**

**Objective:** To ensure the SDK is secure, protects user data, and
prevents fraudulent activities.

**Key** **Security** **Principles:**

> **Defense** **in** **Depth:** Employ multiple layers of security
> controls to protect against various threats.
>
> **Least** **Privilege:** Ensure the SDK and its components operate
> with the minimum necessary permissions.
>
> **Secure** **by** **Design:** Integrate security considerations from
> the initial design phase, rather than as an afterthought.
>
> **Transparency:** Clearly communicate data collection and usage
> practices to developers and end-users.

**Implementation** **Details:**

> . **Data** **Protection** **and** **Privacy:**
>
> **Data** **Minimization:** Collect only the data absolutely necessary
> for the SDK's functionality.
>
> **Encryption:**
>
> **Data** **in** **Transit:** All communication between the SDK and
> backend services (e.g., for scoring, leaderboards, analytics) MUST use
> HTTPS/TLS to encrypt data in transit. This prevents eavesdropping and
> Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
>
> **Data** **at** **Rest:** Sensitive data stored locally on the device
> (e.g., cached scores, user preferences) should be encrypted using
> platform-speciﬁc secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Android Keystore for
> encryption keys, Flutter Secure Storage for encrypted preferences).
>
> **GDPR/CCPA** **Compliance:** Provide clear mechanisms for developers
> to obtain user consent for data collection and processing, especially
> for analytics and personalized notiﬁcations. Implement features for
> data deletion and access requests if applicable.
>
> . **Fraud** **Prevention** **and** **Anti-Tampering:**
>
> **Server-Side** **Validation:** This is the most critical component of
> fraud prevention. All sensitive operations, especially score
> submissions and reward claims, MUST be validated on a trusted backend
> server. The SDK will send suﬃcient context (e.g., spinId,
> selectedSegmentIndex, timestamp,
>
> clientHash) to the server for veriﬁcation. The server should
> independently determine the spin outcome and reward based on its own
> logic and data.
>
> **Obfuscation** **and** **Miniﬁcation:** Apply code obfuscation and
> miniﬁcation techniques to the Flutter module and any native Android
> code. This makes reverse engineering more diﬃcult, deterring casual
> attackers.
>
> **Root/Jailbreak** **Detection** **(Optional** **but**
> **Recommended):** Implement checks to detect if the device is rooted
> or jailbroken. While not foolproof, this can provide an additional
> layer of defense and allow the SDK to adjust its behavior (e.g.,
> disable certain features or log warnings) on compromised devices.
>
> **Signature** **Veriﬁcation:** Verify the integrity of the SDK's own
> code and assets at runtime to detect any unauthorized modiﬁcations.
>
> **Rate** **Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API calls from the
> SDK to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks against backend
> services.

. **API** **Security:**

> **Authentication** **and** **Authorization:**
>
> Use secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth .
>
> tokens) for all backend API calls. API keys should be securely stored
> and rotated regularly.
>
> Implement proper authorization checks on the backend to ensure the SDK
> only performs actions it is permitted to do.
>
> **Input** **Validation:** Strictly validate all input received from
> the SDK on the backend to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL
> injection, XSS).
>
> **Secure** **Token** **Management:** If using tokens (e.g., JWTs),
> ensure they are short-lived, refreshed securely, and stored in secure
> locations (e.g.,
>
> FlutterSecureStorage on the client, HTTP-only cookies or secure
> server-side storage on the backend).
>
> **API** **Key** **Protection:** Provide clear guidance to developers
> on how to securely store API keys (e.g., using environment variables,
> Gradle secrets, or
>
> a secure backend service) and prevent them from being hardcoded or
> exposed in public repositories.
>
> . **Error** **Handling** **and** **Logging:**
>
> Implement secure logging practices. Avoid logging sensitive user data
> or API keys. Use appropriate log levels.
>
> Ensure error messages do not expose sensitive internal information or
> stack traces to the end-user or to publicly accessible logs.

**.** **Analytics** **Framework**

**Objective:** To provide comprehensive event tracking and user insights
without compromising privacy.

**Key** **Analytics** **Principles:**

> **Actionable** **Insights:** Focus on collecting data that can drive
> improvements in user engagement, feature adoption, and monetization.
>
> **Privacy** **by** **Design:** Integrate privacy considerations into
> the analytics framework from the outset.
>
> **Flexibility:** Allow developers to choose their preferred analytics
> platform and customize event tracking.

**Implementation** **Details:**

> . **Event** **Taxonomy** **and** **Standardization:**
>
> Deﬁne a clear and consistent event taxonomy for all tracked events.
> This ensures data consistency and ease of analysis.
>
> **Core** **Events:**
>
> spin_wheel_initialized: When the spin wheel widget is ﬁrst displayed.
>
> spin_started: When a user initiates a spin.
>
> spin_completed: When the spin animation ﬁnishes.
>
> reward_won: When a user wins a reward.
>
> reward_redeemed: When a won reward is successfully redeemed (requires
> integration with host app's reward system).
>
> customization_applied: When a user applies a custom theme or changes
> wheel appearance.
>
> leaderboard_viewed: When a user views a leaderboard.
>
> score_submitted: When a score is submitted to the backend.
>
> **Event** **Properties:** For each event, deﬁne relevant properties to
> capture context. For example, reward_won might include reward_type,
>
> reward_value, segment_index, spin_duration.

. **Analytics** **Provider** **Integration:**

> The AnalyticsManager will act as an abstraction layer, allowing
> developers to plug in diﬀerent analytics providers.
>
> **FirebaseAnalyticsProvider:** Provide a robust implementation for
> Google Analytics for Firebase, which is a common choice for mobile
> apps. This will involve mapping SDK events to Firebase events and user
> properties.
>
> **CustomAnalyticsProvider:** Oﬀer a generic provider interface where
> developers can supply a callback function to receive all SDK events.
> This allows integration with any custom or third-party analytics
> system (e.g., Mixpanel, Amplitude, custom backend logging).

. **User** **Identiﬁcation:**

> The SDK will allow developers to set a userId (e.g., their internal
> user ID) to enable cross-device tracking and personalized analytics.
>
> If no userId is provided, the SDK should use an anonymous device ID
> for tracking.

. **Data** **Collection** **and** **Transmission:**

> Events will be collected locally and then batched and sent to the
> conﬁgured analytics provider to minimize network overhead and battery
> consumption.
>
> Implement retry mechanisms for failed transmissions.
>
> Allow for oﬄine event queuing, where events are stored locally and
> sent once connectivity is restored.
>
> . **Debugging** **and** **Testing** **Analytics:**
>
> Provide a debugMode ﬂag in the SDK conﬁguration that enables verbose
> logging of analytics events to the console. This helps developers
> verify that events are being tracked correctly.
>
> Oﬀer tools or instructions for using analytics platform debug views
> (e.g., Firebase DebugView) to see events in real-time.
>
> . **Performance** **Considerations:**
>
> Ensure analytics tracking does not introduce signiﬁcant performance
> overhead or block the UI thread.
>
> Use asynchronous operations for data transmission.
